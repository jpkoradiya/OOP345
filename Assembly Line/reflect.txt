Purpose: OOP345 Final Project Reflection

I found OOP345 Final Project very useful to myself as I don’t have much experience in working with very big projects. Projects like this help me understand what it is like to work on very big projects and believe in doing a project in small parts. I can’t imagine if we did it all together, how hard it would be to fix an error in Utilities module after coding all 5 modules.

In the project, I found the instructions very clear for all the parts. The part I personally found challenging was the function bool run(std::ostream& os)(). This function wasn’t very clear to me until I attended the class where you explained the function.

I made small addition to a function prototype and a data member type. I declared m_delimiter as a static variable in order to have it until the end of the program or until we change its value. Also, I declared the function void display(std::ostream&) as a const as it doesn’t change any values in the class and therefore, it would be better to have it as a const as we want our code to be as restrictive as possible. Other than that, I got to learn a lot about data structures and working with them.
